Title: Color Picker

Description:
This project, named "Color Picker," is a simple web application designed to provide users with a fun way to associate colors with their zodiac signs. Users can select their zodiac sign from a dropdown menu, and upon clicking the "Generate Color" button, the background color of the webpage changes to a color associated with the chosen zodiac sign.

Features:

Upon selecting a zodiac sign and clicking the "Generate Color" button, the background color of the webpage changes accordingly.
Each zodiac sign is associated with a specific color, making the color generation personalized and relevant to the user's zodiac sign.
If the user selects an invalid option or fails to select any option from the dropdown, an alert message prompts them to make a correct selection.
Technologies Used:
